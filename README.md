### What datasets are you choosing? Cite the source(s).

The dataset chosen for this analysis is the AWS Honeypot Database. This open-source dataset includes detailed information on cyber attacks and attempts, collected over a period from 9:53 PM on March 3, 2013, to 5:55 AM on September 8, 2013. The dataset consists of 451,581 data points, making it sufficiently large and appropriate for thorough analysis. The source of the dataset is detailed on [Data Driven Security's dataset collection page](http://datadrivensecurity.info/blog/pages/dds-dataset-collection.html).

### Why are you choosing this dataset?

We are choosing this dataset because it is well-formatted, straightforward, and includes comprehensive documentation, which facilitates a more in-depth and accurate analysis. Many other datasets we encountered lacked proper documentation and were difficult to interpret based on the file alone. Also considering the popularity of big data and cyber security we felt that the data and it's analyisis were poigent. 

### What you want to learn from your analysis?

From this analysis, we aim to identify trends and correlations within the AWS honeypot data that could be leveraged to predict cyber threat vectors. By examining patterns in the attack data, we hope to uncover insights that can inform proactive cybersecurity measures and improve threat detection strategies.
